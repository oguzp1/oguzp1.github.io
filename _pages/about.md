About Me
=====
I am a 22 year old software engineer from Turkey who graduated from Istanbul Technical University as the highest ranking student of the Department of Computer Enigneering in 2019.

My research interests are Machine Learning and its applications for Computer Vision, and Cross-Modal Learning with visual data and other modalities.

I have been employed at Dcipher Analytics, Istanbul since June 2019, and I develop backend code and do R&D work as a data scientist there.
